## INTRODUCTION:
A password manager is a computer program that allows users to store, generate, and manage their passwords for local applications and online services.
A password manager assists in generating and retrieving complex passwords, storing such passwords in an encrypted database, or calculating them on demand.

## Research
Password managers, though commonly recommended by security experts, are still not used by many users. Understanding why some choose to use password managers while others do not is important towards generally understanding why some users do what they do and, by extension, designing motivational tools such as video tutorials to help motivate more to use password managers. To investigate differences between those who do and do not use a password manager, for this paper, we distributed an online survey to a total of 137 users and 111 non-users of the tool that asked about their opinions/experiences with password managers. Furthermore, since emotion has been identified by work in psychology and communications as influential in other risk-laden decision-making (e.g., safe-sex behavior such as condom use), we asked participants who use a password manager to rate how they feel for 45 different emotions, or, as the case for those who do not use a password manager, to rate how they imagine they would feel the 45 emotions if they did use the tool. Our results show that “users” of password managers noted convenience and usefulness as the main reasons behind using the tool, rather than security gains, underscoring the fact that even a large portion of users of the tool are not considering security as the primary benefit while making the decision. On the other hand, “non-users” noted security concerns as the main reason for not using a password manager, highlighting the prevalence of suspicion arising from lack of understanding of the technology itself. Finally, analysis of the differences in emotions between “users” and “non-users” reveals that participants who never use a password manager are more likely to feel suspicious compared to “users,” which could be due to misunderstandings about the tool.

## SWOT Analysis:
## Strength:
Easy to Maintain Best Practices.
Faster Access for Enrolled Employees.
Easy to Manage Shared Accounts.
Easy to Encrypt Data.
## Weakness:
Single point of failure - if someone gets hold of your master password, they have all your passwords.
Password manager programs are a target for hackers. It's not easy to login using multiple devices.
## Opportunities:
With the increasing internet services penetration, improving communication infrastructure, and data speed improvements, the growing number of internet and mobile users is influencing various businesses, across the world, to adopt the internet to offer their services and products, driving the need for the creation of different profiles by the end-users.
## Threat:
The most obvious risk from using a password manager is that it keeps all of your sensitive login information in one place, so one breach could be catastrophic.
