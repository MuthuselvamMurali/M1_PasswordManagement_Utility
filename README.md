# M1_PasswordManagement_Utility

Passwords are a fundamental part of online security. 
These codes protect our identities and serve as an authentication check for the services people use. 
Unfortunately with the increasing number of passwords required for various services, users can find themselves using passwords for multiple services. 
This reuse increases the risk for the user as a compromised account can unlock more services to the attacker. 
Password manager is a program that helps users create unique passwords without the need to memorise these words. 
These created passwords are for services are stored on the user’s machine so that the user only has to remember a single password to unlock their online services.
Our aim for this program was to safely store passwords, on the user’s computer so that they could be retrieved only by the password owner
